# UI Online HTML Pages

These were collected initially to get as much HTML as possible to create the first set of
translations. I visited as many pages as possible and downloaded the source and was sure to not
edit these things or beautify the file or whatever. Some have my info in there from me
purposefully creating errors in the forms. Likely doesn't have every possible word from the forms,
but a good start.
